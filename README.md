# simply-cyan

Simply Cyan is a Jekyll theme dedicated to text and reading. This theme focuses on readability and clarity.

Three main functions are at work to facilitate the reader's experience : a classic dark/light mode, but also toggles to change the font size and get bigger characters or to change the font-style (by default meant to switch between serif and sans-serif fonts).

The design of Simply Cyan is sober and elegant, yet pop with its bright colorful oblique stripes punctuating the screen.

Symply Cyan can feature a multitude of authors and offers a page to display all of their profiles, as well as an archives page to display all the site's posts.


## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "simply-cyan"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: simply-cyan
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simply-cyan

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `simply-cyan.gemspec` accordingly.
