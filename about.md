## Simply Cyan

Simply Cyan is a [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) theme dedicated to text and reading. This theme focuses on readability and clarity. Different available functions are at work to facilitate the reader's experience.

You can view the demo of the theme [here](https://pquod.github.io/simply-cyan-demo/) 

The design of Simply Cyan is sober and elegant, yet pop with its bright colorful oblique stripes punctuating the screen.

Symply Cyan can feature a multitude of authors and/or categories and it offers a page to display their description, as well as an archives page to display all the site's posts.

## Features

- Available as a theme gem and Github Pages theme
- Compatible with all major browsers

Simply Cyan is a public theme adaptation of a theme I made for a creative writing website, **Internet Exploreur**.

The site is no longer active but an archive can be found [here](https://pquod.github.io/InternetExploreur/). A big thank you to Candice Labrousse, Quentin Leclerc et Robinson Lacotte, who contributed to its design and had lots of useful advices in order to make it beautiful, accessible and enjoyable by the most people possible.
